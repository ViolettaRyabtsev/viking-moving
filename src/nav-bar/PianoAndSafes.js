          Moving a piano is a highly specialized skill that requires both an
          intricate knowledge of how to properly disassemble and prepare the
          piano along with special equipment to both protect and move it. This
          is especially true of baby grand and grand pianos, but less so with
          most upright models. <br></br>
          <br></br> In many cases, the movers must know what NOT to do when
          preparing and moving the piano and this is where many discount piano
          movers go wrong! A piano that is improperly prepared can result in
          major damage, and one that is improperly moved or transported can
          result in serious injuries and major damage.
          <br></br>
          <br></br>
          Correctly moving a piano that normally weighs in excess of 500 pounds
          is much more that having multiple movers using sheer force. Rather, it
          is knowing how the piano is constructed, its heavy vs light areas, and
          how to use the leverage that these areas give the mover to efficiently
          move it. <br></br> <br></br> Along with a small crew of experienced
          piano movers, the owner of Viking is always the lead mover and always
          present in any piano move and has been involved in hundreds of piano
          moves, from the simple and straightforward to the complex and
          complicated! <br></br> <br></br>Viking is also pleased to offer long
          and short-term piano storage at our facility in Whittier, California.

          Please contact us if you are moving a piano and let us talk with you
          about the details of your proposed move and allow us to give you a
          pricing quote. We may not be the cheapest, but do you really want to
          try and save a few dollars and take your chances with a 'discount
          mover'? <br></br> <br></br> Your piano may be the centerpiece of your
          home and you have certainly spent a lot of money on its purchase. Even
          if you do not use VIking Moving and Relocation for your piano, please
          seek someone who knows what they are doing!<br></br>
          <br></br> From time to time, our movers at Viking are confronted with
          unique challenges in our moving services like unusually heavy or large
          items such as safes which range between 300 and 900 (yes 900 LBS!!)
          pounds. Rather than bring multiple movers which can end up costing you
          more money, Viking uses special equipment to move such items safely,
          quickly and efficiently!<br></br>
          <br></br> Although there is a surcharge for items like safes, in the
          long run our clients are better served by paying a little extra for
          this service; sometimes paying a little extra is better than taking a
          chance with another 'discount' moving service who may injure you, your
          property or themselves.
