        <h2>MINIMAL PACK</h2>
        <p>
          At Viking, our highest priority is making sure that your furniture and
          belongings arrive to your new home in the same condition that they
          left. Our minimal pack option is ideal for local or short distance
          moves. Once your movers arrive, we come into your home and pack all of
          your furniture and home furnishings in our moving blankets so they
          will be safe during the moving process and while they are being
          transported.<br></br>
          <br></br> Viking will also specially wrap anything you have that is
          fragile for you. The rest of your belongings are packed by you before
          your movers arrive and are then loaded on your moving truck! Viking
          will also provide re-usable boxes for you to pack things upon request.
          If you find that you have more things than you want to take, but at
          the same time do not want to simply dispose of or throw away your
          things, check out our short and long-term STORAGE SERVICES
        </p>
        <h2>INTERMEDIATE PACK</h2>
        <p>
          Our intermediate pack option is a step up from our basic pack; we come
          into your home and pack books, clothes, audio and visual equipment as
          well as most of your basic belongings. The intermediate pack option is
          best for moves that are longer distance (such as Los Angeles to San
          Francisco or San Francisco to San Diego).<br></br>
          <br></br> Our most important goal at Viking is to make sure your
          furniture and belongings are packed well and not damaged during the
          moving process.<br></br>
          <br></br> If you find that you have more things than you want to take,
          but at the same time do not want to simply dispose of or throw away
          your things, check out our short and long-term <b>STORAGE SERVICES</b>
          .
        </p>
        <h2>FULL PACK</h2>
        <p>
          Viking's full-pack option is exactly as it sounds! We come into your
          home and pack your place from top to bottom in preparation for what
          will be a long-distance move for you. The full pack option includes
          everything including clothing, fragile items, kitchenware,
          electronics, wall hangings, et cetera. As with all of our packing
          options, Viking uses protective and re-useable boxes so that your
          belongings are transported safely and also to reduce the cost of your
          move.
